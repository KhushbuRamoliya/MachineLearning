📘 Machine Learning Case Study Notebook
📌 Overview

This repository contains a practice notebook completed as part of a classroom case study on basic Machine Learning models using Python.

The purpose of this notebook is to understand how different ML algorithms work through small, structured datasets.

🧠 Topics Covered

The notebook includes hands-on implementation of:

Linear Regression (Predict continuous values)

Logistic Regression (Binary classification)

K-Means Clustering (Customer segmentation)

Hierarchical Clustering (Product grouping)

📊 Case Study Scenarios

The models were applied to simple business examples such as:

Predicting salary based on experience

Predicting customer purchase behavior

Predicting student pass/fail

Customer segmentation

Product grouping

🛠 Tools Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-Learn

🎯 Learning Objective

This notebook focuses on:

Understanding supervised vs unsupervised learning

Defining features (X) and target (y)

Training models

Making predictions

Interpreting outputs in business terms

📎 Notes

This is a practice case study for learning purposes and does not use real-world production data.

That’s it. Clean. Academic. Honest.

If you want, I can also:

Make it even shorter (minimal version)

Make it more student-style

Or slightly polished for GitHub portfolio without overselling it 😊

Or slightly polished for GitHub portfolio without overselling it 😊

Perfect 😄 — we’ll make it portfolio-ready but not exaggerated. Clean, confident, and honest.

📊 Machine Learning Fundamentals – Case Study Notebook
📌 Overview

This repository contains a practice notebook completed as part of a Machine Learning case study.

The objective was to implement and understand foundational ML models using small, structured datasets and interpret the results in simple business terms.

This is a learning-focused project demonstrating core concepts rather than a production-level system.

🧠 Models Implemented
🔹 Linear Regression

Predict continuous values (e.g., salary based on years of experience).

🔹 Logistic Regression

Binary classification (e.g., purchase prediction, student pass/fail).

🔹 K-Means Clustering

Customer segmentation based on numerical features.

🔹 Hierarchical Clustering

Product grouping based on similarity between features.

🛠 Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

Scikit-Learn

🎯 Key Learning Outcomes

Through this case study, I practiced:

Defining features (X) and target (y)

Training supervised and unsupervised models

Making predictions

Interpreting outputs in business context

Visualizing model results

Understanding differences between regression, classification, and clustering

📊 Example Business Scenarios

Salary prediction based on experience

Customer purchase behavior prediction

Academic performance prediction

Customer segmentation

Product performance grouping

📎 Note

This notebook is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate understanding of core Machine Learning concepts.
