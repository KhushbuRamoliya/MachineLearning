# 📊 Machine Learning Case Study – Multiple Notebooks

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks created as part of a Machine Learning case study.

Each notebook focuses on a specific ML model and includes 4–5 small business-style practice problems.

The goal of this case study is to understand how different Machine Learning algorithms work and how to interpret results in practical business scenarios.

Each notebook includes:
- Dataset creation
- Model training
- Prediction
- Visualization
- Business interpretation

## 🧠 Models Covered

### 🔹 Linear Regression
Used for predicting continuous values (e.g., salary, house price).

### 🔹 Logistic Regression
Used for binary classification (e.g., pass/fail, buy/not buy).

### 🔹 K-Means Clustering
Used for grouping customers based on similarity.

### 🔹 Hierarchical Clustering
Used for grouping products based on price and demand.
